                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>I have been collaborating with Systematic to update the Lotus Entertainment website. We set them up with a beautifully designed, responsive website complete with a CMS that allowed the site owners to manage all aspects of the website.</p>
                
                <p>I served as the lead back-end developer on this project. Some of my responsibilities included setting up a secure database environment, integrating with libraries such as PHPMailer, and setting up SEO-friendly URL routing.</p>
