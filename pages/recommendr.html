                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>While attending Boston University, I was enrolled in a software engineering class. Part of our grade required us to work on a team of 4 people to build a web app from start to finish over the course of the semester. The teams were randomly chosen, and we were responsible for coming up with the idea, pitching the idea, and then building the app. We came up with "recommendr", a Spotify app that suggested music based upon a) your previous listening habits and b) an action you want to complete. Users can select actions like "Gym", "Party", or "Sleep" and recommendr will use the Spotify API to suggest a playlist based upon the action. So for example, one could expect the Sleep playlist to contain music that is much quieter than the Party playlist. Users can then send that playlist to their Spotify app on their mobile device with the click of a button.</p>
                
                <p>We used Node.js running on the Express framework to handle all authentication and data processing. We setup a simple API that would allow the front end to make calls to retrieve or send data pertaining to a Spotify user. The team also integrated with the Twilio API to make playlist collaboration easy without a user having to first send the playlist to their phone before sharing.</p>
                
                <p>MongoDB was used as a caching system to allow users to easily update playlists. Without keeping track of a generated playlist ID, creating a "Gym" playlist and then another "Gym" playlist would create two separate playlists, since Spotify sees these as distinct. The playlist ID was cached in the database to allow users to simply update their playlists with new tracks.</p>
