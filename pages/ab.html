                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>I am currently working with Systematic, LLC. to maintain and further expand upon the Art Brokerage website, an online marketplace for fine art. My responsibilities involved implementing new features that would go on to serve over 80,000 members. I lead numerous design and development projects to provide helpful tools for the site's visitors to use.</p> 
                <p>
                    Some of the projects I have worked on involved redesigning the AB members area to bring mobile optimization and new functionality to it, as well as redesigning the AB management system to add new features and improve the overall user experience.
